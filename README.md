# LLM Web Agent with Local SearxNG

**A Python command-line agent that enhances a local Large Language Model (LLM) with real-time web search capabilities using a self-hosted SearxNG instance.**

This project provides a tool that accepts user prompts via the command line. When keywords indicating a need for current information or images are detected, it queries a local SearxNG instance. Text results are combined with the original prompt and sent to a local LLM (like Ollama, LM Studio, etc.), while image results (URLs) are displayed directly. The setup uses a custom-configured SearxNG instance running in Podman.

## Features

-   Accepts user prompts via CLI.
-   Detects keywords indicating a need for current information or images.
-   Queries a local SearxNG instance for relevant text snippets or image URLs. **Note:** SearxNG acts as a metasearch engine and forwards these queries to external search engines (like Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc., depending on configuration).
-   For text searches, combines the original prompt with search context and sends it to a local LLM (via an OpenAI-compatible API).
-   For image searches, displays the found image URLs directly.
-   Hides intermediate processing logs for a cleaner user experience.
-   Uses a custom Podman image for SearxNG to ensure correct configuration.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher recommended. Ensure `python` and `pip` are in your system's PATH.
2.  **Podman:** A container engine. The `setup.sh` script will attempt to install it using common package managers (`apt`, `dnf`, `brew`, `winget`) if it's not found. If the automatic installation fails, you'll need to install it manually: [https://podman.io/docs/installation](https://podman.io/docs/installation).
3.  **Bash Environment (for setup script):**
    *   **Windows:** Git Bash (recommended) or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
    *   **macOS/Linux:** Default terminal is usually sufficient.
4.  **Local LM Server (e.g., Ollama, LM Studio, Jan):**
    *   Install your preferred local LLM server.
    *   Download a compatible LLM (e.g., Llama 3, Mistral, etc.) using your server's interface.
    *   Start the server and ensure it provides an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint (often at `http://127.0.0.1:1234` or similar).
    *   Verify the server is running and accessible at its address.
    *   Ensure this address matches the `LOCAL_LM_URL` configured in `llm_web_agent/config.py`.

### Ollama Setup (Optional)

[Ollama](https://ollama.com) is a popular way to run LLMs locally with an OpenAI-compatible API.

1. **Install Ollama:**
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
   
   # Or download from https://ollama.com/download
   ```

2. **Pull a model:**
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2
   ```

3. **Start Ollama (runs in background):**
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

4. **Configure the agent:**
   Edit `llm_web_agent/config.py`:
   ```python
   LOCAL_LM_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1/chat/completions"
   LOCAL_LM_MODEL = "llama3.2"
   ```

   The `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint provides OpenAI API compatibility.

## Setup

1.  **Clone/Download:** Obtain the project files (e.g., `git clone <repository_url>`).
2.  **Configure SearxNG (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Review the `searxng_config/settings.yml` file. It has been pre-configured to enable the JSON API for local access (`127.0.0.1`) and allow the `json` format.
    *   You may wish to customize other settings (e.g., enabled search engines under `engines:`).
    *   **Important:** Ensure the `secret_key` (around line 105) is changed from the default `"ultrasecretkey"` for security if this instance might be exposed. The current file uses a randomly generated key.
3.  **Run SearxNG Setup Script:**
    *   Open your Bash terminal (Git Bash, WSL, etc.).
    *   Navigate to the project's root directory (where `setup.sh` is located).
    *   Make the script executable (if needed): `chmod +x setup.sh`
    *   Run the script: `./setup.sh`
    *   This script will:
        *   Check if Podman is installed and attempt installation if missing.
        *   Verify the Podman service is running and attempt to start it if needed.
        *   Build the custom `my-searxng-custom` Podman image.
        *   Stop and remove any previous container named `searxng`.
        *   Start a new container named `searxng` from the custom image, mapping port 8080.
    *   Wait for the script to complete. Check the output for any errors.
    *   The script will remind you about the Local LM server and ask if you want to start the Python agent immediately.

4.  **Set up Python Environment:**
    *   Navigate to the agent directory: `cd llm_web_agent`
    *   (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  (cmd) or venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 (PowerShell)
        # macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the Agent

1.  **Ensure Services are Running:**
    *   The SearxNG container should be running (started by `setup.sh`). Verify with `podman ps --filter name=searxng`.
    *   Ensure your Local LM API server (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.) is running.
2.  **Run the Python Script:**
    *   Make sure your Python virtual environment is activated (if used).
    *   Navigate to the agent directory: `cd llm_web_agent`
    *   Run the agent: `python agent.py` (or let `setup.sh` start it).
3.  **Interact:** Type your prompts at the `You:` prompt. Use keywords like "latest news", "image of a cat", etc., to trigger web/image searches. Type `quit` or `exit` to stop the agent.
## Security and Privacy

Please review the `Security_Privacy_Analysis.rtf` file for important considerations regarding the security and privacy implications of using this tool, particularly concerning how SearxNG interacts with external search engines and how prompts/results are handled.


## Troubleshooting

*   **SearxNG Container Fails to Start:** Check Podman logs (`podman logs searxng`). Look for port conflicts (8080) or `settings.yml` errors.
*   **Agent Can't Connect to SearxNG:** Ensure the container is running (`podman ps`) and accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. Check firewalls.
*   **Agent Can't Connect to Local LM:** Verify the LM server is running and the `LOCAL_LM_URL` in `llm_web_agent/config.py` is correct.
*   **403 Forbidden from SearxNG:** Check `searxng_config/settings.yml` for correctness *before* running `setup.sh`. Rebuild the image (`./setup.sh` will do this) if you changed the settings file after the initial build.
